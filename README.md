### જ⁀➴ Interconnected mindset

➺ Medicine taught me how to learn in a functional way, to see and treat people as humans, and to investigate problems with clarity and purpose.  

➺ Art allows me to explore ideas, create with my hands, and stay creatively alive.  

➺ Learning technology allows me to integrate all of this: building practical tools for the real world, and to build bridges between ideas.

### ☁︎ Philosophy

I like to understand how things work, how people feel, and how ideas connect.  
If I learn something, I try to make it useful.
