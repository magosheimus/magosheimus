## Hi there, I'm Sheima ^^

A curious explorer of systems, code, medicine, and art.  
I enjoy connecting different fields and turning complex ideas into meaningful tools and creations.

### About me

- Computer Science student with a background in Medicine  
- Interested in cognition, learning systems, and structured knowledge  
- Artist at heart, exploring symbolism, perception, and visual expression  
- Drawn to the intersection of logic, creativity, and human understanding  

### Projects

**Rememorium**  
Symbolic spaced-repetition learning system inspired by cognition, memory, and knowledge architecture.

**Avicena Care**  
Automated medical triage system with continuous machine learning exploration and big data approach.

**Geek Floripa App**  
Custom ordering app built for a real store environment, allowing customers to dynamically choose designs and request personalized print images.

**Other Works**  
Small tools and experiments involving automation, structured thinking, and problem-solving through code.

### Interconnected mindset

Medicine taught me how to learn in a functional way, to see and treat people as humans, and to investigate problems with clarity and purpose.  

Art allows me to explore ideas, create with my hands, and stay creatively alive.  

Managing a clothing store taught me how to work with people and navigate real interpersonal challenges.  

Learning technology allows me to integrate all of this: building practical tools for the real world, and to build bridges between ideas.

### Philosophy

I like to understand how things work, how people feel, and how ideas connect.  
If I learn something, I try to make it useful.
