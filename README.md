## ⋆˚꩜｡ Hi there, I'm Sheima ^^

A curious explorer of systems, code, medicine, and art.  
I enjoy connecting different fields and turning complex ideas into meaningful tools and creations.

**Other Works**

### જ⁀➴ Interconnected mindset

Medicine taught me how to learn in a functional way, to see and treat people as humans, and to investigate problems with clarity and purpose.  

Art allows me to explore ideas, create with my hands, and stay creatively alive.  

Managing a clothing store taught me how to work with people and navigate real interpersonal challenges.  

Learning technology allows me to integrate all of this: building practical tools for the real world, and to build bridges between ideas.

### ☁︎ Philosophy

I like to understand how things work, how people feel, and how ideas connect.  
If I learn something, I try to make it useful.
